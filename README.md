Welcome to my personal portfolio repository!  
I’m a passionate Web Developer with a strong foundation in Web 2.0 technologies and a growing enthusiasm for the world of Web 3.0. I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript

Currently, I’m expanding my skills into decentralized technologies, exploring smart contracts, blockchain development, and how Web3 can shape the future of the internet. I enjoy learning, experimenting, and staying at the forefront of digital innovation.

Whether it's crafting clean UI/UX experiences or diving into decentralized apps (dApps), I'm excited to bridge the gap between traditional web development and the decentralized web.
